## FAQ
1. Is my Amazon user name and purchased items visible to any third party?
No. This chrome extension doesn't connect to any backend server, it only tells chrome to help you do the clicking. the data is visible only to you and Amazon server, as they always was.
2. Why am I sometimes prompted with a "login" notification?
Amazon detects such automated clicking behavior, so sometimes it will require you to login again. Fresh Watcher is optimized to avoid this, soit doesn't happen often.
